# Release v1.1 (Draft)

Overview
- Manage the Python project using `uv`.
- Allow selecting CPU-only or CUDA environments.
- Get VQ-VAE running end-to-end.
- Ensure the app computes loss during both training and testing.
- Support custom samples (grayscale 128x128).
- Add explanatory documentation to `docs/`.

Requirements (MUST)
- [ ] Project management via `uv` (repository configured for `uv`).
- [ ] Option to run on CPU-only and CUDA-enabled machines.
- [ ] VQ-VAE implementation that can train and generate samples.
- [ ] Training and testing code paths calculate and log loss values.
- [ ] Support for custom sample inputs (grayscale 128x128) including preprocessing.
- [ ] Documentation updates covering setup, usage, and examples.

Acceptance Criteria
- All MUST items are implemented and covered by Issues/PRs.
- CI passes for major workflows (unit tests, linting, basic training run).
- CHANGELOG entry prepared for v1.1.

Testing / Verification
- Unit tests and integration tests exercise the new functionality.
- Manual test: run training on a small dataset (CPU and CUDA if available) and verify loss is computed and logged.
- Manual test: run inference on a 128x128 grayscale sample and confirm output is produced.

Release Notes (Draft)
- Adds support for managing the project with `uv` and selecting CPU/CUDA runtimes.
- Integrates a working VQ-VAE pipeline.
- Ensures losses are computed during train and test flows in the app.
- Adds support for custom grayscale 128x128 samples.
- Improves documentation and adds usage examples.

Release process
1. Merge PR #9 into main (already prepared).
2. Ensure all related Issues/PRs are closed and milestone v1.1 is complete.
3. Tag the release: `git tag -a v1.1 -m "v1.1"` and push.
4. Create a GitHub Release v1.1 with these notes and link related Issues/PRs.

Notes
- If you prefer a different branch name than `main`, change the branch in the commit.
